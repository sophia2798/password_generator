# Random Password Generator

## Description

This repository is comprised of an HTML, JavaScript, and two CSS files. One CSS file is reset file to reduce browser inconsistencies and the other is the style sheet used to style the page.

The page prompts the user for a password length (between 8-128 characters) and four criteriums - numbers, special characters, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. Once the criteriums are chosen, the random password is created and dislayed in the dashed text box. The user can then choose to copy the random password to their clipboard. 

This project focuses on the use of JavaScript logic, conditional statements, functions, and DOM knowledge to generate the random password. It also focuses on the use of JavaScript to dynamically edit HTML.
